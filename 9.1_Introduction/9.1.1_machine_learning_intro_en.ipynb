    "\n",
    "The greater variety in the samples you have, the easier it is to find relevant patterns and predict the result. Therefore, we need three components to teach the machine:\n",

    "### Data \n",
    "\n",
    "Want to detect spam? Get samples of spam messages. Want to forecast stocks? Find the price history. Want to find out user preferences? Parse their activities on Facebook. The more diverse the data, the better the result. Tens of thousands of rows is the bare minimum for the desperate ones.\n",

    "Also known as parameters or variables. Those could be car mileage, user's gender, stock price, word frequency in the text. In other words, these are the factors for a machine to look at.\n",

Note that, while gradient descent can be susceptible to local minima in general, the optimization problem we have posed here for linear regression has only one global, and no other local, optima; thus gradient descent always converges (assuming the learning rate $\\alpha$ is not too large) to the global minimum. Indeed, $J$ is a convex quadratic function."

But in the long run, you will see the cost decreasing with fluctuations. Also because the cost is so fluctuating, it will never reach the minima but it will keep dancing around it.\n",

Doing this helps us achieve the advantages of both the former variants we saw. \n",
